# SomeGoodNews
This past year, the whole world was thrown into an unprecedented situation.
Constantly consuming news about the pandemic can lead to excessive mental stress and fatigue.
Which is why our team, inspired by [John Krasinski's YouTube show](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOe_y6KKvS3PdIfb9q9pGug), **aims to bring you only good news from around the world.**
Fear and worrying are normal responses in times of uncertainty but we hope that our application will remind people that there’s still lots of things to appreciate.
This android application allows you to scroll through some wholesome news, 'like' them to save them for later, or submit your own stories to continue spreading the love!:revolving_hearts:
