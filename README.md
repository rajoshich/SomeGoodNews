# SomeGoodNews
The whole world was thrown into an unprecedented situation.
Constantly consuming news about the pandemic can lead to excessive mental stress and fatigue.
Which is why our team was inspired by [John Krasinski's YouTube show](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOe_y6KKvS3PdIfb9q9pGug)
and **aims to bring you only good news from around the world.**
